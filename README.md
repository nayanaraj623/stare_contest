Project Description
Stare Contest Game is a gloriously useless two-player web app that tries (and often fails) to detect who blinks first using a webcam. Built with face detection, it boldly claims to referee blink-offs ‚Äî but let's be honest, it mostly stares back at you while not noticing a thing.

Perfect for burning time, frustrating friends, and reminding yourself that not all tech needs a purpose‚Ä¶ or to work.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There is no official or automated way to determine who blinks first during a stare contest. Manual judging can be biased or unreliable.


The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We developed a web-based application using AI-powered face and eye tracking to automatically detect eye blinks and determine the winner of a staring contest. It works right from your browser using a webcam.
